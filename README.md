<p>In this course I teach you the current best practice way to build an audio streaming application on android. To make it more interesting, I designed it to look similar to the popular music streaming app called Spotify.<a href="https://codingwithmitch.com/courses/android-audio-streaming/"> View screen shots</a>.</p>

<p>I use the ExoPlayer library for streaming the audio files. The audio files are located online in a Firebase Firestore database. </p>
